## 🎯 Learning Goal

Phyzics is built to make complex formulas **intuitive**, **visual**, and **interactive**  
so students can understand concepts instead of memorizing equations.

---

## ⚡ Future Roadmap

- Graph plotting for motion equations  
- Adjustable parameters (mass, angle, velocity)  
- Quantum wave visualizer  
- Dark/Light theme toggle  
- Mobile optimization
